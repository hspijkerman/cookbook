1. Pound chicken cutlets between plastic wrap to an even 1/2” thickness for even frying.

2. Marinate chicken – In a large mixing bowl, combine marinade ingredients, add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2-4 hours or overnight.

3. Dredge Chicken – In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together: flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. Lift a piece of marinated chicken, letting excess marinade drip off, and dip chicken into the flour mixture, pressing it on with your hands to coat well. Transfer to a wire rack. Keep the flour mixture for step 5.

4. Heat 1-inch of oil in a soup pot or dutch oven to 350˚F. See our favorite oils for frying below.

5. Re-dip the chicken into the flour mixture just before frying. Add chicken 2 pieces at a time so you don’t crowd.

6. Fry the Chicken – Adjust the temperature of the oil to keep it at 300-325˚F while frying. Cook 3-4 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook 2-3 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 160-165˚F. Transfer to a wire rack.
