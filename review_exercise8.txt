1) Now create a directory developer01/client01 -> should only be developer01
2) test01 is a new file so git commit -a, won't add it. test02 does exists
3) Now to test the git pull in switch to developer01\remote-repo01-client01 -> What the heck??
4) cd developer0 -> cd developer01
5) cd remote-repo01-client01 -> this directory does not exits. We used "git clone ../remote-repo01-client01.git ." to clone so all files are stored in the current directory and not in a child "remote-repo01-client01.git"
